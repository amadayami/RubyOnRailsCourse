# there IS a difference between single and double quote Strings

# String concatenation
first_name = "cotton-eyed"
last_name = "joe"
puts first_name + " " + last_name

# String interpolation
# can't do with single quote

puts "My first name is #{first_name} and my last name is #{last_name}"

# can have an interactive console like in repl.it using irb command locally (interactive ruby)

# Methods, how to find them
# can run obj.methods (ex. first_name.methods)
# obj.method.method is called method chaining
# an empty string is not nil

# Common methods

# Variable assignment
# not really pass by value or pass by reference

# Escaping
# use backslash to escape
