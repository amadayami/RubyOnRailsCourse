## naming conventions/style

# snake case is for method names, variable assignments

# indent with 2 tabs
# apparently this is a big identifier for some reason
# but it's just convention for the sake of nesting and stuff

# class names should be in camel case
# technically true camel case doesn't have the first letter capitalized (which would be PascalCase)
# class names need to be capitalized

class SomeClass

end

# can look for a ruby style guide later
